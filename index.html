          <h2>Bob Managerman</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="bio">Bob Managerman is a highly respected Executive Branch Manager with 7 years of experience and absolutely zero suspicion from his coworkers that he is, in fact, a cat in a very convincing business suit. Bob excels at strategic planning, team leadership, and knocking pens off desks when no one is looking. Known for his uncanny ability to nap with his eyes open during meetings and his ruthless efficiency in chasing down quarterly goals (and laser pointers), Bob has climbed the corporate ladder with the quiet grace of a predator stalking a rogue spreadsheet. When he's not herding humans or approving budgets with a pawprint stamp, Bob enjoys sunbeams, cardboard boxes, and pretending not to understand Zoom. A true professional. A dedicated leader. Definitely not hiding a tail under that tailored suit.</p>
